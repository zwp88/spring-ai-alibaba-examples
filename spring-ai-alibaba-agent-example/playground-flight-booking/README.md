# AI powered expert system demo

This app shows how you can use Spring AI Alibaba to build an AI-powered system that:

- Has access to terms and conditions (retrieval augmented generation, RAG)
- Can access tools (Java methods) to perform actions (Function Calling)
- Uses an LLM to interact with the user

Add to the POM the Spring AI Alibaba boot starter:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-ai-alibaba-starter-dashscope</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-RC1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Add the DashScope configuration to the `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.ai.dashscope.api-key=${AI_DASHSCOPE_API_KEY}
spring.ai.dashscope.chat.options.model=qwen-max
```

## Build Jar

```shell
./mvnw clean package
```

```shell
java -jar ./target/playground-flight-booking-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Build Frontend (as needed)

Run the following command to build frontend, this is only necessary when you made changes to frontend.
